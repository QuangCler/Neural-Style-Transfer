# Neural-Style-Transfer (NST)

Neural Style Transfer is the ability to create a new image (known as a pastiche) based on two input images: one representing the content and the other representing the artistic style.

This repository contains a lightweight PyTorch implementation of art style transfer discussed in the seminal paper by [Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) To make the model faster and more accurate, a pre-trained VGG19 model is used.
